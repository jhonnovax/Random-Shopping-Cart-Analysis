# Project Steps
* Discovery:   
  * Project Objective  
    * Improve NPV  
    * Retain Customers  
  * Project Requirements  
    * Reduce churn rate by 5%  
  * Business Problem  
* Data preparation  
  * Do I have enough good quality data to start building a model?  
* Model planning  
  * Do I have a good idea about the type of model to try? Can I refine the analytic plan?  
* Model building  
  * Is the model robust enough? Have we failed for sure?  
* Communicate results  
* Operationalize
